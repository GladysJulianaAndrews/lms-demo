    <h1> About Library Management </h1>
	<img src="about_icon.png">
	<p>The Mission is to Empower the Minds to be the inventors and creators.</p>
	<p>Around us, so much is being done for various entertainment and so little for the knowledge, Books & Libraries not even a part of most discussions.</p>
    <p>But I believe that by widening the reach of Library & Books, making it available, by giving education on reading Books physically!!!!.</p>
    <p>Physical books can help in deep focus and concentration. Unlike digital screens, it has no distractions like notifications or advertisements..</p>
    <p>So thats where this LMS plays a major role. You can buy the books in library for free of cost and return it once done. You can also renew your due dates. </p>
    <p>The Speciality here is, you can see the Frequently Sold Books, Famous Author and also the List of Books available.</p>
